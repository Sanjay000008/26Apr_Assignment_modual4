# 17) When is the finally block executed?

"""
    The finally block always executes when the try block exits.This ensures that the finally 
    block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs.But finally is useful for more than just exception handling
    it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return,
    countinue,or break.
