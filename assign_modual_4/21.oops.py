# 21)What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java

""""
    Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.
    Multiple Inheritance is the process in which a subclass inherits more than one superclass.
    Java does not support Multiple Inheritance;however,Java interfaces help us achieve Multiple
    Inheritance of type in java.

    Inheritance is the mechanism to achieve the re-usability of code as one class(child class)
    can derive the properties of another class(parent class).It also provides transitivity ie. if class c inherits
    from p then all the sub-classes of C would also inherit from P then all the sub-classes of C would also
    inherit from P
