# 25) Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What 
# Is A Constructor In Python?

""""
    Inheritance relationship defines the classes that inherit from other cklasses as derived,
    subclass,or sub-type classes.Base class remains to be the source from which a subclass 
    inherits.
    for example 'Animal' is Base class and "lion" is a Derived class

"""
    The __init__ method is the Python equivalent of the C++ constructor in an object-oriented
    approach.The __init__ function is called every time an object is created from a class.
    the __init__ method lets the class initialize the object's attributes and services no other
    purpose.It is only used within classes.
"""

"""
    Constructor are generally used for instantiating an object.The task of counstructor is to
    initialize(assign values) to the data members of the class when an object of the class is
    created.In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always called when
    an objet is created.
