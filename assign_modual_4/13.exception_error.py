# 13) Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python?

"""
Exceptio:-
    Exception handling is a mechanism that separates code that detects and handles exceptional
    cricumstances from the rset of your program. Note that an exceptional circumstance is not
    necessarily an error. When a function detects an exceptional situation, you represent 
    this with an object.

"""
Erorr:-
    A logical error occurs in Python when the code runs without any syntex or runtime error
    but produces incorrect results due to flawed logic in the code
